# 🚩Objectives
In this paper, we
1. Verify that there is substantial migraine-related chatter available on social media (Twitter and Reddit), self-reported by those with migraine;
2. Develop a platform-independent text classification system for automatically detecting self-reported migraine-related posts, and
3. Conduct analyses of the self-reported posts to assess the utility of social media for studying this problem.
